        MISO, which stands for Major Island Soccer Organization (originally stood for Menâ€™s Island Soccer Organization), was founded in August of 1996 by a group of players and teams to provide the island of Oahu it's then only men's USSF sanctioned league, as well as seeking something different from what was available at the time.  Many people spoke of creating such a League, but it wasn't until Cesar Robledo stepped forward and decided to organize the players and teams, that the League started taking form. Cesar would later become MISO's first President, with Sergio Bolioli as second VP.
